  <p>This was my entry for the <a href="http://2015.js13kgames.com" alt="Js13kGames" target="_blank">Js13kGames compo 2015</a>, a 
  Javascript coding competition for HTML5 Game Developers where the file size limit is set to a maximum of 13 
  kilobytes (compressed and minified). The theme for this year was <strong>Reversed</strong> and it took me ~113 
  hours to complete the game with a final size of <strong>11848 bytes</strong>. Please, die finished in the 34th 
  position of 160 participants.</p>

  <p>In typical platformers you have to avoid enemies, avoid pits, collect stuffs, stay alive as long as 
  possible and be happy. <strong>Please, die</strong> is not the typical platformer. Things are kind of reversed here, so 
  you have to help our little character with a very simple task: <em>to die</em>.</p>

  <p>No frameworks were used to develop this game, just pure javascript. Some of the interesting things achieved
  in this game were:
    <ul>
      <li>Simple physics with forces and gravity</li>
      <li>Collisions system using an hybrid of AABB + SAT algorithm</li>
      <li>Particles system with tainting effect on walls</li>
      <li>ASCII maps for levels</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Tested on Chrome and Firefox. Other browsers must work too but it hasn't been tested.</p>

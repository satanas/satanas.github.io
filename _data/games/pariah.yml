  <p>This was my entry for the <a href="http://2014.js13kgames.com" alt="Js13kGames">Js13kGames compo 2014</a>, a 
  Javascript coding competition for HTML5 Game Developers where the file size limit is set to a maximum of 13 
  kilobytes (compressed and minified). The theme for this year was <strong>Elements</strong> and the final size of the
  package was <strong>12793 bytes</strong>.</p>

  <p>Pariah is set in a world where the destiny of humanity it's on the hands of one man that was rejected by society, 
  labeled as crazy and locked up into a dungeon. Is the story of the last man in earth, is the story of the pariah.</p>

  <p>This game was released under the figure of LudusPactum, with the valuable participation of 
  <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGagzu" target="_blank">Alexander Hass</a> in the graphics and 
  <a href="https://twitter.com/xabadu" target="_blank">Fernando Larrañaga</a> in the AI.</p>

  <p>No frameworks were used to develop this game, just pure javascript. Among the interesting things developed 
  for this title are:
    <ul>
      <li>Collisions system using AABB algorithm</li>
      <li>Ray casting algorithm to create the fog effect</li>
      <li>Procedural generated dungeons</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Tested on Chrome and Firefox. Other browsers must work too but it hasn't been tested.</p>

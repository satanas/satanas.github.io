  <p><strong>Octocoder</strong> is a tetris-like game where you have to collect code blocks and deploy them into 
  applications. Combine the blocks to build popular applications and earn lots of points. Avoid unknown applications 
  or your stack will grow.</p>

  <p>This game was born as a fork <a href="https://github.com/ogoshen/game-off-2012" target="_blank">Octocat Jump</a> and was my 
  entry for the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1972-the-game-has-changed" target="_blank">Github Game Off 2015</a> competition, where 
  you had to take an existing game and change it (code, graphics, sounds or whatever you wanted). Octocoder ended as 
  one of the 12 winners of the compo</p>

  <p>It works in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It probably works in other browsers but I haven't tested.</p>

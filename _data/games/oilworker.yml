  <p><strong>OilWorker</strong> is an addictive and challenging puzzle game where you get contracts to build a pipeline 
  that will allow transport oil from one point to another. Your starting point is an oil well and random pieces of 
  pipes (a-la tetris) will be given to you to build the pipe system that must lead to the oil refinery. The oil will start
  flowing after a few seconds and if it can get to the refinery, you win the level, the contract and lots of money. If 
  the oil spills then you get fired and go back home with empty hands.</p>

  <p>The game was developed in PyGame and counts with 20 levels. Graphics and development done by me. Sounds were 
  downloaded from an open source archive.</p>

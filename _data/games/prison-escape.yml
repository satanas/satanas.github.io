  <p>This was my entry for the 2016 edition of the <a href="http://2016.js13kgames.com" alt="Js13kGames" target="_blank">js13kGames compo</a>,
  a Javascript coding competition for HTML5 Game Developers where the file size limit is set to a maximum of 13 
  kb (13312 bytes) and no external libraries are allowed. The theme for this year was <strong>Glitch</strong> and it 
  took me 37 hours 42 min to complete with a final size of <strong>11873 bytes</strong>. Prison Escape finished in the 20th 
  position of 127 participants.</p>

  <p>A glitch in a prison complex could be something terrible, and it's up to you to take advantage of those glitches 
  to escape. Avoid the cops, collect the coins and use the power ups to run the 1 km that separates you from freedom.</p>

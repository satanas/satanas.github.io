  <p>Octocoder is a tetris-like game where you have to collect code blocks and deploy them into applications. 
  Combine the blocks to build popular applications and earn lots of points. It was born as a fork of 
  <a href="https://github.com/ogoshen/game-off-2012">Octocat Jump</a> and was my entry for the 
  <a href="https://github.com/blog/1972-the-game-has-changed">Github Game Off 2015</a> competition.</p>

  <p>It works in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It probably works in other browsers but I haven't tested.</p>

  <p>This is my entry for the <a href="http://js13kgames.com" alt="Js13kGames">Js13kGames compo 2015</a>, a JavaScript coding competition for HTML5 Game Developers 
  where the file size limit is set to a maximum of 13 kilobytes (compressed and minified). 
  The theme for this year was <strong>Reversed</strong> and it took me ~113 hours to complete the game with a final size is of <strong>11848 bytes</strong>.</p>

  <p>In typical platformers you have to avoid enemies, avoid pits, collect stuffs, stay alive as long as 
  possible and be happy. <strong>Please, die</strong> is not the typical platformer. Things are kind of reversed here, so 
  you have to help our little character with a very simple task: <em>to die</em>.</p>
  
  <p>Tested on Chrome and Firefox. Other browsers must work too but I haven't tested.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>What is the best thing you can do when people are mean? THROW THEM TOMATOES!</p>

<p>Throw tomatoes, make combos &amp; streaks, complete challenges, use power-ups to boost your score and compete with
friends finger-to-finger to see who is the best. All of this before the time ends and, of course, avoiding the nice
people out there. You must throw tomatoes only to the mean people.</p>

<p>Tomatromp is more than a silly game, is our response to the current situation of society. Is our way to express our
rejection to bigotry, hatred, racism, sexism, and any kind of discrimination. Is our way to convey the message that
intolerance is bad and instead, we should respect and care for each other. So, Tomatromp is not only a silly game, it
is a silly game that gives you the opportunity to throw tomatoes to mean people and say "Take that, hater!".</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>The concept of the game is very simple: throw a bunch of tomatoes. However, you cannot throw tomatoes to everyone. At
the beginning of the round you will be introduced with a mean person and you need to make sure that you only hit that
person, otherwise you will incur in mistakes, and after a certain number of mistakes you will lose.</p>

<p>The game has two modes of play, single-player and two-players. In the single-player mode you must complete a series
of challenges every round. These challenges can go from score at least certain number of points to hit several times
the mean character without failures. The two-players mode is a competitive mode where you will face a friend (both
in the same device) and they one with the highest score at the end of the round will win.</p>

<p>During the course of the game you will see rainbow balloons and, if you hit them, you will activate a power up.
Power ups will help you boost your score, freeze the timer or even remove the penalties temporarily.</p>
